📊 Bank Loan Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of bank loan data to understand customer behavior, loan approval trends, and repayment risk patterns.
The main objective is to transform raw banking data into meaningful insights that can assist financial institutions in making data-driven lending decisions.

The project simulates a real-world banking scenario where data analysts are required to clean, explore, and interpret structured financial datasets to support credit risk assessment and loan evaluation.

🎯 Objectives of the Project

To analyze customer and loan attributes influencing loan approval decisions

To identify patterns related to loan repayment and default risk

To perform data cleaning and preprocessing for reliable analysis

To generate actionable insights from financial data using analytical techniques

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains structured bank loan information, including:

Customer income and employment details

Loan amount and loan term

Credit history

Loan approval status

Repayment indicators

This dataset represents a typical banking loan dataset used for credit evaluation and risk analysis.

🔍 Methodology & Workflow

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Corrected data types for numerical and categorical variables

Ensured data quality for accurate analysis

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed loan approval and rejection trends

Studied the impact of income, credit history, and loan amount

Compared repayment behavior across different customer groups

Identified patterns related to high-risk and low-risk borrowers

3️⃣ Insights & Analysis

Credit history was observed as a key factor influencing loan approval

Income and loan amount showed strong relationships with repayment behavior

Certain customer profiles indicated higher default risk

Insights derived can help banks improve risk assessment strategies
